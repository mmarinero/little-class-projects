Little Projects
===============

Some little programs I did to learn some stuff, low level assembly code usually
Code is not always polished and english/spanish comments and names are mixed. I will fix it if I extend them.

* Matrix multiplication splitting matrix and using several processes.
* 10^x calculation with the FPU.
* Easy operation using c inline assembly blocks.
* Image blending with MMX instructions.
* FFT using SSE code to improve performance.
* Assembly implementation of some low level multiplication and division algorithms.
* Calculator written in Sparc assembly.
* Music search webapp.
* Float point triangle area calculation.
